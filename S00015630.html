						Mercury has been known to us since 300BC and is a very small planet close to the sun making it hard to see. 
						Mercury can only been seen with a telescope before sunset or just after dawn. 
						It appears as a small spot in front of the surface of the sun. 
						There is no life on Mercury,  extreme temperature changes make this impossible.

						Venus is the second planet from the sun and the hottest one in our solar system with temperatures 
						up to 462°C. It is often referred to as Earths sister planet as they are similar in size, mass and density 
						but it is thought to be the least hospitable planet due to its intense heat. Venus is one of the brightest 
						objects in the sky next to the sun and the moon, it is the sixth largest planet in our solar system.  
						The surface of the planet is rocky and covered in cratered and volcanic land. It also has clouds on the surface made up of sulphuric acid, 
						these clouds are so thick that they stop the heat escaping from the planet keeping the temperature high.

				Earth is the largest of the inner planets and the only planet in our solar system that is known to support life.  
				Formed around 4.5 billion years ago Earth is the only planet not named after a Roman or Greek God or Goddess, instead 
				it is an English/German word meaning the ground. The Earth is the third planet from the sun. Our atmosphere, made up of 
				78% nitrogen and 21% oxygen, protects us from the sun’s ultraviolet solar radiation and incoming meteoroids which mostly
				break up when entering the atmosphere. Earth orbits the sun every 365 days, known as 1 year.

			Named after the Roman god of war Mars is the last one of the inner planets.  It has two moons and takes 24 
			hours and 37 minutes to spin once on its axis. Mars is a rocky planet, this is referred to as a terrestrial planet. 
			Over 40 spacecrafts have been launched to explore Mars but only around 16 have been successful.

        <h2>Mars, whats it like?</h2>
		<p id="funFact"><em>Fun Fact</em></p>
        <p>Mars is very cold. The average temperature on Mars is minus 80 degrees Fahrenheit -- way below freezing!
			Mars is rocky with canyons, volcanoes and craters all over it. Red dust covers almost all of Mars. 
			It has clouds and wind, just as Earth does. Sometimes the wind blows the red dust into a dust storm. 
			Tiny dust storms can look like tornados, and large ones can cover the whole planet!</p>

        <h2>What Has NASA Learned About Mars?</h2>
        <p>NASA has used both spacecr aft and robots to learn more about Mars. In 1965, Mariner 4 was the first NASA spacecraft to get a close look at the planet. 
			In 1976, Viking 1 and Viking 2 were the first NASA spacecraft to land on Mars. They took pictures and explored the planet’s surface. 
			Since then, more spacecraft have flown near or landed on Mars.>
			NASA's Spirit and Opportunity rovers landed on Mars in January 2004. They found evidence that water once flowed on Mars. 
			Living things need water to survive. So, any sign of water on Mars would mean that there could be, or could have been, life on the planet. </p>
      </article>
      <article class="one_quarter lastbox">
        <h2>How Is NASA Exploring Mars Today?</h2>
        <p>
			Today, three spacecraft are circling above, or orbiting, Mars. 
			The spacecraft are using scientific tools to measure the volcanoes, canyons, craters, temperature and the kinds of minerals on Mars. 
			They also are taking pictures and searching for water. Two robots that move, called rovers, are exploring Mars’ surface. 
			Their names are Opportunity and Curiosity. The rovers travel around taking pictures and looking closely at the planet’s soil and rocks. 
			NASA uses pictures and information from the spacecraft and the rovers to learn more about Mars.
